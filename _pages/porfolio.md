## ?? Plant Disease Detection System  
**Tech Stack:** TensorFlow, Keras, Flask, Python, Docker, HTML/CSS, Git  
**Role:** ML Engineer & Full-Stack Developer  
- Trained a CNN using TensorFlow/Keras on an extensive dataset of plant leaf images to detect and classify multiple plant diseases.  
- Built a Flask-based web interface for real-time image uploads and predictions.  
- Dockerized the application for consistent deployment across different environments.  
- Applied data augmentation and dropout layers to prevent overfitting and improve generalization.  
- Validated model performance using confusion matrix and accuracy/loss plots.

## ?? Postal Office Web Application  
**Tech Stack:** JavaScript, Node.js, SQL, React  
**Role:** Backend & Frontend Developer  
- Designed and implemented a multi-role system for customers and employees to interact with package tracking and customer records.  
- Built backend APIs in Node.js for package lookup, record updates, and employee management.  
- Developed React components for dynamic tracking search, record modification, and role-based views.  
- Created SQL schema to support relational data management for customers, packages, and staff.

## ??? Chilliwack Academic Approval System  
**Tech Stack:** Flask, SQLAlchemy, MSAL, Microsoft Graph API, HTML/CSS, Jinja2, Docker  
**Role:** System Architect & Full-Stack Developer  
- Developed a secure login system using Microsoft Office 365 OAuth (MSAL) and Microsoft Graph API to authenticate users and fetch profile data.  
- Implemented user role initialization and access control with decorators (admin, basic user, privileged user).  
- Created modular Jinja2 templates for `home`, `dashboard`, and `admin` views with dynamic rendering of user info and profile pictures.  
- Integrated Flask-Migrate and SQLAlchemy for database migrations and ORM-based user/role management.  
- Ensured persistent session tracking with Flask-Session and server-side file-based storage.  
- Admin dashboard features include role management, session validation, and future approval routing integration.

## ?? Mr. Wisdom – AI Chatbot  
**Tech Stack:** JavaScript, HTML/CSS, Google Firebase  
**Role:** Frontend Developer & Firebase Integrator  
- Built a context-aware chatbot interface that leverages rule-based logic and simulated NLP responses.  
- Integrated Firebase Realtime Database to save user chat history and enable persistent sessions across refreshes.  
- Implemented UI styling and animations to mimic a conversational chat environment.

## ?? U.S. Medical Insurance Cost Analysis  
**Tech Stack:** Python, Matplotlib, Jupyter Notebook  
**Role:** Data Analyst  
- Cleaned and processed real-world health insurance data to analyze patterns in medical charges.  
- Implemented class-based structures and helper functions for modular analysis (e.g., filtering smokers vs. non-smokers).  
- Visualized trends using Matplotlib: age vs. cost, BMI vs. charges, regional distribution of expenses.  
- Presented insights on how factors like smoking status and number of children influence premium costs.
